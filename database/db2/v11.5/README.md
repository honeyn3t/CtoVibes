# Installing DB2 11.5.4 on a Redhat 9.4 box
The following are the steps to take to install redhat 11.5.4 on a redhat server, and then to connect to that server from another machine. Note that there are 3 users that are required for this to happen. We also provide a companion code snipet that will provide a connection from a remote server to the db2 server.
