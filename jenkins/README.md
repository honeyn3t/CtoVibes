# CTO Vibes

The Irish honeynet team have been working in the tech sector for a long time. Part of every tech leaders role is mentoring new and growing careers to get them going in the right trajectory. Often some of the most simple but arguably poor documented things can get folks hung up and loose hours or even days trying to evaluate a particular technical direction.

This project consists of a number of helper sample files to help others get going quicker.  The content will generally be simple concept implementations or working snippets of code that do basic tasks. Hopefully these files represent the foundation of what is needed to perform an evaluation of a technology implementation.

We do not say this code is production ready, we simply say that it performs the task. We will leave its suitablity to living in a case-by-case hostile environment up to you.

Hopefully you find this helpful.
